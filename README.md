#spiderchat

PÃ³kchat, or Spiderchat, is a local internet-based chat system where you can choose an IP and port to chat with. This is written in C#.

You and your partner need to do the command "ipconfig" in cmd.exe. Put your ipv4 in the  Client1 IP box and their IP in the other IP Box. They need to do this but vise-versa.

Use port 80 for yourself and 81 for your partner. Again, do vise versa for them. Click the connect button (the one with the chain icon) and you'll be connected. Simply put a message in the chat box and click send and they'll see it.

You are "Client" and they are "Conferee"
